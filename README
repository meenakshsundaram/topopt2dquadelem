topopt2dquadelem is a matlab library for topology optimizing in 2d systems. 
The objective function is here done for strain energy. An example that 
demonstrates this is in bridgedemo.m. Try running it. The code is right now
tuned for plane stress. Plane strain is also a possibility, one just has
to uncomment the plane strain constitutive law.
